NAME
    MySQL::Sandbox - Quickly installs MySQL side server, either standalone
    or in groups

SYNOPSIS
     make_sandbox /path/to/MySQL-VERSION.tar.gz

     make_sandbox $HOME/opt/mysql/VERSION

     make_sandbox VERSION

PURPOSE
    This package is a sandbox for testing features under any version of
    MySQL from 3.23 to 6.0.

    It will install one node under your home directory, and it will provide
    some useful commands to start, use and stop this sandbox.

    With this package you can play with new MySQL releases without need of
    using other computers. The server installed in the sandbox use
    non-standard data directory, ports and sockets, so they won't interfere
    with existing MYSQL installations.

INSTALLATION
    MySQL Sandbox installs as a normal Perl Module. Since its purpose is to
    install side servers in user space, you can install it as root (default)
    or as an unprivileged user. In this case, you need to set the PERL5LIB
    and PATH variables.

       # as root
       perl Makefile.PL 
       make
       make test
       make install

       # as normal user
       export PATH=$HOME/usr/local/bin:$PATH
       export PERL5LIB=$HOME/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8
       perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/usr/local
       make
       make test
       make install

    See also under "TESTING" for more options before running 'make test'

MAKING SANDBOXES
  Single server sandbox
    The easiest way to make a sandbox is

    1  download the sandbox package and install it as instructed above

    2  download a MySQL binary tarball

    3  run this command

          $ make_sandbox  /path/to/mysql-X.X.XX-osinfo.tar.gz

    That's all it takes to get started. The Sandbox will ask you for
    confirmation, and then it will tell you where it has installed your
    server.

    By default, the sandbox creates a new instance for you under

       $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_X_X_XX

  Making a replication sandbox
    It's as easy as making a single sandbox

       $ make_replication_sandbox /path/to/mysql-X.X.XX-osinfo.tar.gz

    This will create a new instance of one master and two slaves

       under $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_X_X_XX

  Circular replication
    It requires an appropriate option when you start a replication sandbox

       $ make_replication_sandbox --circular=4 /path/to/mysql-X.X.XX-osinfo.tar.gz

    This will create a replication system with three servers connected by
    circular replication. A handy shortcut is "--master_master", which will
    create a circular replication system of exactly two members.

  Multiple sandboxes
    You can create a group of sandboxes without any replication among its
    members. If you need three servers of the same version, you can use

     $ make_multiple_sandbox /path/to/tarball 
    
    If you need servers of different versions in the same group, you may
    like

     $ make_multiple_custom_sandbox /path/to/tarball1 path/to/tarball2 /path/to/tb3 

    Assuming that each tarball is from a different version, you will group
    three servers under one directory, with the handy sandbox scripts to
    manipulate them.

  Creating a sandbox from source
    If you want to create a sandbox from the code that you have just
    compiled, but you don't want to install, there is a script that makesa
    binary tarball for you and installs a sandbox in one go.

     $ make_sandbox_from_source {SOURCE_DIRECTORY} {sandbox_type} [options]

    The first parameters is the directory where you have successfully run
    "./configure && make". The second parameter is what kind of sandbox you
    want to create: One of the following:

      * single
      * multiple
      * replication
      * circular

    You can then add all the options you need at the end. For example:

     $ make_sandbox_from_source $HOME/build/5.0 single --export_binaries --check_port 

    or

     $ make_sandbox_from_source $HOME/build/5.0 replication --how_many_slaves=5

    If you call this program several times from the same directory, it will
    check if the compiled binaries are newer than the extracted ones, and if
    they aren't, it will reuse the ones created during the previous run,
    thus saving time and CPU.

  Defaults and shortcuts
    If you use sandboxes often, instead of pointing to a tarball you can set
    a directory containing expanded tarballs. By default, the sandbox looks
    under $HOME/opt/mysql and /opt/mysql

    The expanded tarballs must be named with the full version. e.g.

      $HOME/opt/mysql/5.0.64 
      /opt/mysql/5.1.24
    
    If you have such an organization, then you can invoke every sandbox
    script with this abridged syntax:

      make_sandbox 5.0.64
      make_replication_sandbox 5.1.25
      make_multiple_custom_sandbox 5.0.64 5.1.25

    If you use some options frequently, it would make sense to add them to
    the default option file, which is $HOME/.msandboxrc

  Fine tuning
    Every sandbox script will give you additional information if you invoke
    it with the "--help" option.

    When creating a single sandbox, you can pass to the new server most any
    option that can be used in a my.cnf file, in addition to specific
    sandbox options.

    Multiple and replication sandboxes, for example, accept a
    --how_many_slaves=X or --how_many_nodes=X option, allowing you to create
    very large groups.

  SANDBOX HOME
    Unless you override the defaults, sandboxes are created inside a
    directory that servers two purposes:

    *  further isolates the sandboxes, and keep them under easy control if
       you are in the habit of creating many of them;

    *  provides a set of handy super-commands, which can be passed to all
       the sandboxes. Running "$SANDBOX_HOME/stop_all" you will stop all
       servers of all sandboxes, single or groups, below that directory.

USING A SANDBOX
    Change directory to the newly created one (default:
    $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_VERSION for single sandboxes)

    The sandbox directory of the instance you just created contains some
    handy scripts to manage your server easily and in isolation.

    start
    restart
    stop
       "./start", "./restart", and "./stop" do what their name suggests.
       "start" and "restart" accept parameters that are eventually passed to
       the server. e.g.:

         ./start --skip-innodb

         ./restart --event-scheduler=disabled

    use
       "./use" calls the command line client with the appropriate
       parameters,

    clear
       "./clear" stops the server and removes everything from the data
       directory, letting you ready to start from scratch.

    multiple server sandbox
       On a replication sandbox, you have the same commands, with a "_all"
       suffix, meaning that you propagate the command to all the members.
       Then you have "./m" as a shortcut to use the master, "./s1" and
       "./s2" to access the slaves (and "s3", "s4" ... if you define more).

       In group sandboxes without a master slave relationship (circular
       replication and multiple sandboxes) the nodes can be accessed by
       ./n1, ./n2, ./n3, and so on.

       start_all
       restart_all
       stop_all
       use_all
       clear_all
       m
       s1,s2

  Database users
    There are 2 database users installed by default:

     +-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+
     |  user name      | password    | privileges                    |
     +-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+
     |  root@localhost | msandbox    | all on *.* with grant option  |
     |  msandbox@%     | msandbox    | all on *.*                    |
     +-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+

  Ports and sockets
    Ports are created from the server version. a 5.1.25 server will use port
    5125, unless you override the default. Replicated and group sandboxes
    add a delta number to the version figure, to avoid clashing with single
    installations.

    (note: ports can be overriden using -P option during install)

     +--------+-----------------------------+
     | port   | socket                      |
     +--------+-----------------------------+
     |  3310  | /tmp/mysql_sandbox3310.sock |
     +--------+-----------------------------+

  Searching for free ports
    MySQL Sandbox uses a fairly reasonable system of default ports that
    guarantees the usage of unused ports most of the times. If you are
    creating many sandbozes, however, especially if you want several
    sandboxes using the same versions, collisions may happen. In these
    cases, you may ask for a port check before installing, thus making sure
    that your sandbox is really not conflicting with anything.

   Single sandbox port checking
    The default behavior when asking to install a sandbox over an existing
    one is to abort. If you specify the "--force" option, the old sandbox
    will be overwritten. Instead, using the "--check_port" option, MySQL
    Sandbox searches for the first available unused port, and uses it. It
    will also create a non conflicting data directory. For example

     make_sandbox 5.0.79
     # creates a sandbox with port 5079 under $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_0_79

    A further call to the same command will be aborted unless you specify
    either "--force" or "--check_port".

     make_sandbox 5.0.79 --force
     # Creates a sandbox with port 5079 under $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_0_79
     # The contents of the previous data directory are removed.

     make_sandbox 5.0.79 --check_port
     # Creates a sandbox with port 5080 under $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_0_79_a

     make_sandbox 5.0.79 --check_port
     # Creates a sandbox with port 5081 under $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_0_79_b

   Multiple sandbox port checking
    When you create a multiple sandbox (make_replication_sandbox,
    make_multiple_sandbox, make_multiple_custom_sandbox) the default
    behavior is to overwrite the existing sandbox without asking for
    confirmation. The rationale is that a multiple sandbox is definitely
    more likely to be a created only for testing purposes, and overwriting
    it should not be a problem. If you want to avoid overwriting, you can
    specify a different group name ("--replication_directory"
    "--group_directory"), but this will use the same base port number,
    unless you specify "--check_base_port".

     make_replication_sandbox 5.0.79
     # Creates a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_0_79
     # The default base_port is 7000

     make_replication_sandbox 5.0.79
     # Creates a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_0_79
     # overwriting the previous one. The default base port is still 7000

     # WRONG
     make_replication_sandbox --check_base_port 5.0.79
     # Creates a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_0_79
     # overwriting the previous one. 
 
     # WRONG
     make_replication_sandbox --replication_directory=newdir 5.0.79
     # Created a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/newdir.
     # The previous one is preserved, but the new sandbox does not start
     # because of port conflict.

     # RIGHT
     make_replication_sandbox --replication_directory=newwdir \
        --check_base_port 5.0.79
     # Creates a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/newdir
     # The previous one is preserved. No conflicts happen

  Environment variables
    All programs in the Sandbox suite recognize and use the following
    variables:

     * HOME the user's home directory; ($HOME)
     * SANDBOX_HOME the place where the sandboxes are going to be built. 
       ($HOME/sandboxes by default)
     * USER the operating system user;
     * PATH the execution path;
     * if SBDEBUG if set, the programs will print debugging messages

    In addition to the above, make_sandbox will use * SANDBOX_BINARY or
    BINARY_BASE the directory containing the installation server binaries
    (default: $HOME/opt/mysql)

    make_replication_sandbox will recognize the following * MASTER_OPTIONS
    additional options to be passed to the master * SLAVE_OPTIONS additional
    options to be passed to each slave * NODE_OPTIONS additional options to
    be passed to each node

    The latter is also recognized by make_multiple_custom_sandbox and
    make_multiple_sandbox

    The test suite, "test_sandbox", recognizes two environment variables

     * TEST_SANDBOX_HOME, which sets the path where the sandboxes are
       installed, if the default $HOME/test_sb is not suitable. It is used
       when you test the package with 'make test'
     * PRESERVE_TESTS. If set, this variable prevents the removal of test
       sandboxes created by test_sandbox. It is useful to inspect sandboxes
       if a test fails.

SBTool the Sandbox helper
    The Sandbox Helper, "sbtool", is a tool that allows administrative
    operations on already existing sandboxes. It does a number of important
    tasks that are not available at creation time or that would require too
    much manual labor.

        usage: sbtool [options] 
        -o     --operation       (s) <> - what task to perform
             'info'     returns configuration options from a Sandbox
             'copy'     copies data from one Sandbox to another
             'ports'    lists ports used by the Sandbox
             'tree'     creates a replication tree
             'move'     moves a Sandbox to a different location
             'range'    finds N consecutive ports not yet used by the Sandbox
             'port'     Changes a Sandbox port

        -d     --dest_dir        (s) <> - destination directory for move,copy
        -n     --new_port        (s) <> - new port while moving a sandbox
        -u     --only_used       (-) <> - for "ports" operation, shows only the used ones
        -i     --min_range       (i) <5000> - minimum port when searching for available ranges
        -x     --max_range       (i) <64000> - maximum port when searching for available ranges
        -z     --range_size      (i) <10> - size of range when searching for available port range
        -f     --format          (s) <text> - format for "ports" and "info"
             'perl'     fully structured information in Perl code
             'text'     plain text dump of requested information
        -p     --search_path     (s) </Users/gmax/sandboxes> - search path for ports and info
        -a     --all_info        (-) <> - print more info for "ports" operation
               --tree_nodes      (s) <> - description of the tree (x-x x x-x x|x x x|x x)
               --mid_nodes       (s) <> - description of the middle nodes (x x x)
               --leaf_nodes      (s) <> - description of the leaf nodes (x x|x x x|x x)
               --tree_dir        (s) <> - which directory contains the tree nodes
        -v     --verbose         (-) <> - prints more info on some operations
        -h     --help            (-) <1> - this screen

  sbtool - Informational options
   sbtool -o info
    Returns configuration options from a Sandbox (if specified) or from all
    sandboxes under $SANDBOX_HOME (default). You can use "--search_path" to
    tell sbtool where to start. The return information is formatted as a
    Perl structure.

   sbtool -o ports
    Lists ports used by the Sandbox. Use "--search_path" to tell sbtool
    where to start looking (default is $SANDBOX_HOME). You can also use the
    "--format" option to influence the outcome. Currently supported are only
    'text' and 'perl'. If you add the "--only_used" option, sbtool will
    return only the ports that are currently open.

   sbtool -o range
    Finds N consecutive ports not yet used by the Sandbox. It uses the same
    options used with 'ports' and 'info'. Additionally, you can define the
    low and high boundaries by means of "--min_range" and "--max_range". The
    size of range to search is 10 ports by default. It can be changed with
    "--range_size".

  sbtool - modification options
   sbtool -o port
    Changes port to an existing Sandbox. This requires the options
    "--source_dir" and "--new_port" to complete the task. If the sandbox is
    running, it will be stopped.

   sbtool -o copy
    Copies data from one Sandbox to another. It only works on single
    sandboxes. It requires the "--source_dir" and "--dest_dir" options to
    complete the task. Both Source and destination directory must be already
    installed sandboxes. If any of them is still running, it will be
    stopped. If both source and destination directory point to the same
    directory, the command is not performed. At the end of the operation,
    all the data in the source sandbox is copied to the destination sandbox.
    Existing files will be overwritten. It is advisable, but not required,
    to run a "./clear" command on the destination directory before
    performing this task.

   sbtool -o move
    Moves a Sandbox to a different location. Unlike 'copy', this operation
    acts on the whole sandbox, and can move both single and multiple
    sandboxes. It requires the "--source_dir" and "--dest_dir" options to
    complete the task. If the destination directory already exists, the task
    is not performed. If the source sandbox is running, it will be stopped
    before performing the operation. After the move, all paths used in the
    sandbox scripts will be changed.

   sbtool -o tree
    Creates a replication tree, with one master, one or more intermediate
    level slaves, and one or more leaf node slaves for each intermediate
    level. To create the tree, you need to create a multiple nodes sandbox
    (using "make_multiple_sandbox") and then use "sbtool" with the following
    options:

     * --tree_dir , containing the sandbox to convert to a tree
     * --master_node, containing the node that will be master
     * --mid_nodes, with a list of nodes for the intermediate level
     * --leaf_nodes, with as many lists as how many mid_nodes
       Each list is separated from the next by a pipe sign (|).

    Alternatively, you can use the "--tree_nodes" option to describe all the
    tree at once.

    For example, in a sandbox with 8 nodes, to define 1 as master node,
    nodes 2 and 3 as middle nodes, nodes 4, 5, and 6 as slaves of node 2 and
    nodes 7 and 8 as slaves of node 3, you can use either of the following:

     sbtool --tree_dir=/path/to/source \
        --master_node=1 \
        --mid_nodes='2 3'
        --leaf_nodes='4 5 6|7 8'

     sbtool --tree_dir=/path/to/source \
        --tree_nodes='1 - 2 3 - 4 5 6|7 8' 

   sbtool -o preserve
    Makes a sandbox permanent. It requires the "--source_dir" option to
    complete the task. This command changes the 'clear' command within the
    requested sandbox, disabling its effects. The sandbox can't be erased
    using 'clear' or 'clear_all'. The 'delete' operation of sbtool will skip
    a sandbox that has been made permanent.

   sbtool -o unpreserve
    Makes a sandbox NOT permanent. It requires the "--source_dir" option to
    complete the task. This command cancels the changes made by a 'preserve'
    operation, making a sandbox erasable with the 'clear' command. The
    'delete' operation can be performed successfully on an unpreserved
    sandbox.

   sbtool -o delete
    Removes a sandbox completely. It requires the "--source_dir" option to
    complete the task. The requested sandbox will be stopped and then
    deleted completely. WARNING! No confirmation is asked!

TESTING
  test_sandbox
    The MySQL Sandbox comes with a test suite, called test_sandbox, which by
    default tests single,replicated, multiple, and custom installations of
    MySQL version 5.0.77 and 5.1.32.You can override the version being
    tested by means of command line options:

     test_sandbox --versions=5.0.67,5.1.30

    or you can specify a tarball

     test_sandbox --versions=/path/to/mysql-tarball-5.1.31.tar.gz
     test_sandbox --tarball=/path/to/mysql-tarball-5.1.31.tar.gz

    You can also define which tests you want to run:

      test_sandbox --tests=single,replication

  Test isolation
    The tests are not performed in the common $SANDBOX_HOME directory, but
    on a separate directory, which by default is "$HOME/test_sb". To avoid
    interferences, before the tests start, the application runs the
    "$SANDBOX_HOME/stop_all" command. The test directory is considered to
    exist purely for testing purposes, and it is erased several times while
    running the suite. Using this directory to store valuable data is higly
    risky.

  Tests during installation
    When you build the package and run

      make test

    test_sandbox is called, and the tests are performed on a temporary
    directory under "$INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY/t/test_sb". By default, version
    5.0.77 is used. If this version is not found in "$HOME/opt/mysql/", the
    test is skipped. You can override this option by setting the
    TEST_VERSION environment variable.

      TEST_VERSION=5.1.30 make test
      TEST_VERSION=$HOME/opt/mysql/5.1.30 make test
      TEST_VERSION=/path/to/myswl-tarball-5.1.30.tar.gz make test

  User defined tests
    Starting with version 2.0.99, you can define your own tests, and run
    them by

      $ test_sandbox --tests=user --user_test=file_name

    Inside your test file, you can define test actions. There are two kind
    of tests: shell and sql the test type is defined by a keyword followed
    by a colon.

    The 'shell' test requires a 'command', which is passed to a shell. The
    'expected' label is a string that you expect to find within the shell
    output. If you don't expect anything, you can just say "expected = OK",
    meaning that you will be satisfied with a ZERO exit code reported by the
    operating system. The 'msg' is the description of the test that is shown
    to you when the test runs.

      shell:
      command  = make_sandbox 5.1.30 --no_confirm
      expected = sandbox server started
      msg      = sandbox creation

    The 'sql' test requires a 'path', which is the place where the test
    engine expects to find a 'use' script. The 'query' is passed to the
    above mentioned script and the output is captured for further
    processing. The 'expected' parameter is a string that you want to find
    in the query output. The 'msg' parameter is like the one used with the
    'shell' test.

      sql:
      path    = $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_1_30
      query   = select version()
      expected = 5.1.30
      msg      = checking version

    All strings starting with a $ are expanded to their corresponding
    environment variables. For example, if $SANDBOX_HOME is /home/sb/tests,
    the line

      command  = $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_1_30/stop

    will expand to:

      command = /home/sb/tests/msb_5_1_30/stop

REQUIREMENTS
    To use this package you need at least the following:

    *  Linux or Mac OSX operating system (it may work in other *NIX OSs, but
       has not been tested)

    *  A binary tarball of MySQL 3.23 or later

    *  Perl 5.8.1 or later

    *  Bash shell
