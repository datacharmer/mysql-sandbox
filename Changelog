	- improved 'stop' script. If the server is a slave, calls "stop slave"
	  before closing down.
2.0.4 12-Jul-2008

	- Fixed bug #244236 (low_level_make_sandbox accepts unnecessary arguments)
	- Fixed bug in low_level_make_sandbox. sandbox_home was not checked
	  for correctness. It is a simple name, and it should not accept

	  thus it was changed to upper_directory.

	- added the execution of a "./clear" command when "--force" was used
	  to avoid overwriting a running server.
