	Makes the intrusive mysqldump that was running with load_grants

3.0.60	25-Jul-2015
	- Changed installation method for MySQL 5.7.6 and later. 
	Using 'mysqld --initialize' instead of deprecated mysql_install_db.
	Installation for earlier MySQL versions and MariaDB still use
	mysql_install_db.
	- Due to the above change, low_level_make_sandbox will now filter the
	"error" message in the output for the text '[Warning]'. If an "error"
	appears as warning, the installation is not halted.
	- Incompatible change: when using --force to install on top of an existing
	sandbox, the old data directory is copied to 'old_data' instead of being
	overwritten. This is due to the different behavior of 'mysqld --initialize' 
	that does not support initializing an existing data directory.

	the new database was being removed.
3.0.49	08-Apr-2015
	- Fixed version detection to support also MySLQL 5.7.7 and MySQL 5.7.8.
	  A more resilient patch will follow.

	  replication and in general any topology containing a relay slave may fail.
3.0.48	09-Mar-2015
	- Added provisional support for MySQL 5.7.6 (changed syntax for SET
	PASSWORD but keep using deprecated mysql_install_db)

	  for correctness. It is a simple name, and it should not accept

	- added the execution of a "./clear" command when "--force" was used
	  to avoid overwriting a running server.

	  have clashing port numbers.

1.13 23-Oct-2007
	- (INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE) removed '.sh' suffix from all scripts
